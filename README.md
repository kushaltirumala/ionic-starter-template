# Ionic Template
Just a simple account-based app template in Ionic (only front-end, no backend). Please read below if you have questions about Ionic/how the app is set up.

Based off the ionic sidemenu starter project, with a few tweaks to help explain the ionic framework a little better. Visit [Ionic.io](http://ionic.io) to get some more info.

Update:  08/17/2015 - still working on styling, but haven't pushed all my changes yet. Will push when all thr styling changes + commenting is done.
